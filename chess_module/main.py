"""Main entry point for two-player interactive chess.

How a move works (always three steps):
  1. Type a start square   (example: e2)
  2. Type a destination    (example: e4)  -> preview appears, nothing is played yet
  3. Type F                -> the move is finalized / played

Type N at any time to cancel and pick a different piece.
Type help for a command list.
